/**
 * GraphQL DataLoader registry, and the depth/width guards over incoming queries.
 *
 * ── Why this file lives here and not in the engine ────────────
 *
 * It used to be `packages/engine/src/lib/graphql-dataloader.ts`, reachable only
 * through `ctx.internals`. That was residue of a move already finished:
 * `routes/index.ts` says "GraphQL auto-generated API — moved to
 * extensions/developer/graphql" in three places, and the engine serves no
 * GraphQL route. The feature left; its batching and its two DoS guards stayed
 * behind.
 *
 * Measured before moving, by importer rather than by name: no engine route and
 * no engine module imported it — `lib/extensions/internals.ts` was its single
 * importer, and this extension its single caller.
 *
 * The only engine coupling was the `Database` TYPE. The value was always the
 * caller's own handle, which here is `ctx.db`.

 * Reject a query that asks for too many top-level fields.

 * Depth was already limited, and each list resolver already clamps to 500 rows.
 * Neither bounds the WIDTH: a single POST can alias the same root field six
 * hundred times, and every alias is a separate query at the full row cap. An
 * audit measured 600 aliases returning 200 OK in 0.42 s — up to three hundred
 * thousand rows for one request that the rate limiter counted as one request,
 * because it counts requests and this is about cost.
 *
 * Counted rather than parsed, in the same spirit as `checkQueryDepth` above:
 * this runs before the schema is built, on a string that may not even be valid
 * GraphQL, and a cheap conservative count is the right tool at that point. It
 * walks the top level only — `{` and `}` track nesting, so fields inside a
 * selection are somebody else's problem (the depth check's).
 *
 * Fifty is far above any interface a person drives and far below a query that
 * hurts. A caller that genuinely needs more should send more requests, which is
 * exactly what the rate limiter is there to price.
