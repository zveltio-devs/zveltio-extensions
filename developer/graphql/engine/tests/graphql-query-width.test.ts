/**
 * Depth bounds how deep one field goes. Nothing bounded how many there are.
 *
 * `list_*` already clamps every resolver to 500 rows and `checkQueryDepth`
 * already refuses deep nesting, so both of the obvious costs were priced. Width
 * was not: one POST can alias the same root field six hundred times, and each
 * alias is a separate query at the full row cap. An audit measured 600 aliases
 * answering 200 OK in 0.42 s, up to three hundred thousand rows — and the rate
 * limiter saw one request, because it counts requests and this is about cost.
