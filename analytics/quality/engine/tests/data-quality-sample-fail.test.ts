/**
 * data-quality.ts — the normalization sampler is skipped OUT LOUD when the
 * sample cannot be read.
 *
 * It carried `.catch(() => [])`, which handed the analyser an empty sample.
 * An empty sample finds nothing and reports nothing, so a table whose rows could
 * not be read produced the same result as a table with no problems — and the
 * scan still completed and still said so.
 *
 * The scan's other checks are unaffected on purpose: a failed sample is a reason
 * to skip one check, not to throw away the duplicates and outliers already
 * found.
